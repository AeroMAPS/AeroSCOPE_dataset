# Welcome 
AeroSCOPE is a project that aims to bring together various open data sources on air transport in order to better understand the geographical distribution of air transport.
More details on data collection and compilation can be found in the article accompanying this work: XXXX (TODO)


## Setup

It is suggested to use a new [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) virtual environment to install the required packages.
Pyhton 3.10 is suggested, altough older versions might work.

In the new virtual environment, navigate to the project folder. Most installs are made using poetry, except for poetry itself whic can be nstalled using pip or conda.

```bash
pip install poetry 
poetry install 
```
